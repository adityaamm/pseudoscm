"""The workflow's assertions and the corpus cannot drift apart — D108.

WHY THIS EXISTS

The CI workflow asserts properties of the generated corpus by reading fields from it
directly. D104 renamed one of those fields in the generator and in this suite, and
**left the workflow reading the old name** — so the push failed on a step that had
nothing to do with the change, with a KeyError three files from the edit.

That is the same defect D104 itself fixed: a name changed in one place and not another,
with nothing comparing the two. Introduced, in the same commit, by the person writing
about it.

WHY THE WORKFLOW READS THE CORPUS AT ALL

It could call this suite and stop there, and then it would prove less. These tests run
against `src/`; the workflow runs against the INSTALLED package from outside the
checkout, which is what catches a packaging fault. The duplication is deliberate and
the drift is what needed handling.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT CHECKED

Every quoted key the workflow reads from a corpus row must exist on a row of that kind.
Keys belonging to scenario results and other dictionaries are listed in
`NOT_CORPUS_FIELDS` rather than guessed at — a list of reasons somebody has to add to
deliberately, which is the same shape Gate 13's declarations take.
