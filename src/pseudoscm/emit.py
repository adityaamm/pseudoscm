"""File emission — pseudoscm.

Contract-shaped JSONL, one file per canonical entity, the same shape `pseudohcm` emits.

**Written even when empty**, deliberately: an absent file and an empty one say
different things to whoever is loading them. Absent reads as *this harness does not
know about business metrics*; empty reads as *it does, and this run produced none*.
Only the second is ever true here.
